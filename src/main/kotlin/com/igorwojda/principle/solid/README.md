# SOLID

Set of 5 design principles for object-oriented programming. When they are applied together, it is more likely that
the software will be easier to maintain and extend over software lifetime.

The `SOLID` acronym is created from first the letter of each principle name:

- [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](singleresponsibility/README.md)
- [Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](openclosed/README.md)
- [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](liskovsubstitution/README.md)
- [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](interfacesegregation/README.md)
- [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](dependencyinversion/README.md)

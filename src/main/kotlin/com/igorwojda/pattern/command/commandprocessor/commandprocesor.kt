/*
 * Command pattern is often used with que-based command processor.
 *
 * The Processor can queue and execute commands according to its internal logic, but from the Invoker
 * point of view, it doesnâ€™t really matter. The Receiver is moved from a command to the command processor,
 * thus the commands will only take its parameters, and the rest will be handled by command processor when
 * calling the execute().
